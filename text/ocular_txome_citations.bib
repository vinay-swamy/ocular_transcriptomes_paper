	abstract = {Most human genes generate multiple transcript isoforms. The differential expression of these isoforms can help specify cell types. Diverse transcript isoforms arise from the use of alternative transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites and splice sites; however, the relative contribution of these processes to isoform diversity in normal human physiology is unclear. To address this question, we investigated cell type-dependent differences in exon usage of over 18 000 protein-coding genes in 23 cell types from 798 samples of the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. We found that about half of the expressed genes displayed tissue-dependent transcript isoforms. Alternative transcription start and termination sites, rather than alternative splicing, accounted for the majority of tissue-dependent exon usage. We confirmed the widespread tissue-dependent use of alternative transcription start sites in a second, independent dataset, Cap Analysis of Gene Expression data from the FANTOM consortium. Moreover, our results indicate that most tissue-dependent splicing involves untranslated exons and therefore may not increase proteome complexity. Thus, alternative transcription start and termination sites are the principal drivers of transcript isoform diversity across tissues, and may underlie the majority of cell type specific proteomes and functions.},

	abstract = {Alternative transcriptional initiation (ATI) refers to the frequent observation that one gene has multiple transcription start sites (TSSs). Although this phenomenon is thought to be adaptive, the specific advantage is rarely known. Here, we propose that each gene has one optimal TSS and that ATI arises primarily from imprecise transcriptional initiation that could be deleterious. This error hypothesis predicts that (i) the TSS diversity of a gene reduces with its expression level; (ii) the fractional use of the major TSS increases, but that of each minor TSS decreases, with the gene expression level; and (iii) cis-elements for major TSSs are selectively constrained, while those for minor TSSs are not. By contrast, the adaptive hypothesis does not make these predictions a priori. Our analysis of human and mouse transcriptomes confirms each of the three predictions. These and other findings strongly suggest that ATI predominantly results from molecular errors, requiring a major revision of our understanding of the precision and regulation of transcription.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.
RESULTS: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.},

	abstract = {Ultra-deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a powerful approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We previously developed multivariate analysis of transcript splicing (MATS), a statistical method for detecting differential alternative splicing between two RNA-Seq samples. Here we describe a new statistical model and computer program, replicate MATS (rMATS), designed for detection of differential alternative splicing from replicate RNA-Seq data. rMATS uses a hierarchical model to simultaneously account for sampling uncertainty in individual replicates and variability among replicates. In addition to the analysis of unpaired replicates, rMATS also includes a model specifically designed for paired replicates between sample groups. The hypothesis-testing framework of rMATS is flexible and can assess the statistical significance over any user-defined magnitude of splicing change. The performance of rMATS is evaluated by the analysis of simulated and real RNA-Seq data. rMATS outperformed two existing methods for replicate RNA-Seq data in all simulation settings, and RT-PCR yielded a high validation rate (94\%) in an RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Our data also provide guiding principles for designing RNA-Seq studies of alternative splicing. We demonstrate that it is essential to incorporate biological replicates in the study design. Of note, pooling RNAs or merging RNA-Seq data from multiple replicates is not an effective approach to account for variability, and the result is particularly sensitive to outliers. The rMATS source code is freely available at rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/. As the popularity of RNA-Seq continues to grow, we expect rMATS will be useful for studies of alternative splicing in diverse RNA-Seq projects.},

	abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (

We detected the temporal order of their enzymatic incorporation into a growing DNA strand with zero-mode waveguide nanostructure arrays, which provide optical observation volume confinement and enable parallel, simultaneous detection of thousands of single-molecule sequencing reactions. Conjugation of fluorophores to the terminal phosphate moiety of the dNTPs allows continuous observation of DNA synthesis over thousands of bases without steric hindrance. The data report directly on polymerase dynamics, revealing distinct polymerization states and pause sites corresponding to DNA secondary structure. Sequence data were aligned with the known reference sequence to assay biophysical parameters of polymerization for each template position. Consensus sequences were generated from the single-molecule reads at 15-fold coverage, showing a median accuracy of 99.3\%, with no systematic error beyond fluorophore-dependent error rates.

However, while a global change in transcription is recognized as a defining feature of cancer, the contribution of alternative promoters still remains largely unexplored. Here, we infer active promoters using RNA-seq data from 18,468 cancer and normal samples, demonstrating that alternative promoters are a major contributor to context-specific regulation of transcription. We find that promoters are deregulated across tissues, cancer types, and patients, affecting known cancer genes and novel candidates. For genes with independently regulated promoters, we demonstrate that promoter activity provides a more accurate predictor of patient survival than gene expression. Our study suggests that a dynamic landscape of active promoters shapes the cancer transcriptome, opening new diagnostic avenues and opportunities to further explore the interplay of regulatory mechanisms with transcriptional aberrations in cancer.},

As the human proteome is not a static entity, it seems necessary to estimate the number of different protein species (proteoforms) and measure the number of copies of the same protein in a specific tissue. Here, meta-analysis of neXtProt knowledge base is proposed for theoretical prediction of the number of different proteoforms that arise from alternative splicing (AS), single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs), and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Three possible cases are considered: (1) PTMs and SAPs appear exclusively in the canonical sequences of proteins, but not in splice variants; (2) PTMs and SAPs can occur in both proteins encoded by canonical sequences and in splice variants; (3) all modification types (AS, SAP, and PTM) occur as independent events. Experimental validation of proteoforms is limited by the analytical sensitivity of proteomic technology. A bell-shaped distribution histogram was generated for proteins encoded by a single chromosome, with the estimation of copy numbers in plasma, liver, and HepG2 cell line. The proposed metabioinformatics approaches can be used for estimation of the number of different proteoforms for any group of protein-coding genes.},

	abstract = {Ginkgo biloba, which contains flavonoids as bioactive components, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. Increasing the flavonoid production of medicinal plants through genetic engineering generally focuses on the key genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such biosynthesis are not yet well understood. To understand these mechanisms, a combination of second-generation sequencing (SGS) and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing was applied to G. biloba. Eight tissues were sampled for SMRT sequencing to generate a high-quality, full-length transcriptome database. From 23.36 Gb clean reads, 12,954 alternative polyadenylation events, 12,290 alternative splicing events, 929 fusion transcripts, 2,286 novel transcripts, and 1,270 lncRNAs were predicted by removing redundant reads. Further studies reveal that 7 AS, 5 lncRNA, and 6 fusion gene events were identified in flavonoid biosynthesis. A total of 12 gene modules were revealed to be involved in flavonoid metabolism structural genes and transcription factors by constructing co-expression networks. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis reveals that some hub genes operate during the biosynthesis by identifying transcription factors (TFs) and structure genes. Seven key hub genes were also identified by analyzing the correlation between gene expression level and flavonoids content. The results highlight the importance of SMRT sequencing of the full-length transcriptome in improving genome annotation and elucidating the gene regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in G. biloba by providing a comprehensive set of reference transcripts.},

Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.
Results: Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100 bp in length, ≥1 kb genomic reads at error rate ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.

While cost-effective and accurate for quantification, short-read RNA-seq lacks the ability to resolve full-length transcript isoforms despite increasingly sophisticated computational methods. Long-read sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) bypass the transcript reconstruction challenges of short reads. Here we introduce TALON, the ENCODE4 pipeline for platform-independent analysis of long-read transcriptomes. We apply TALON to the GM12878 cell line and show that while both PacBio and ONT technologies perform well at full-transcript discovery and quantification, each displayed distinct technical artifacts. We further apply TALON to mouse hippocampus and cortex transcriptomes and find that 422 genes found in these regions have more reads associated with novel isoforms than with annotated ones. We demonstrate that TALON is a capable of tracking both known and novel transcript models as well as their expression levels across datasets for both simple studies and in larger projects. These properties will enable TALON users to move beyond the limitations of short-read data to perform isoform discovery and quantification in a uniform manner on existing and future long-read platforms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We tested what native features have been preserved with a new culture protocol for adult human RPE.
METHODS: We cultured RPE from adult human eyes. Standard protocols for immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, electrophysiology, fluid transport, and ELISA were used.
RESULTS: Confluent monolayers of adult human RPE cultures exhibit characteristics of native RPE. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated polarized expression of RPE markers. Electron microscopy illustrated characteristics of native RPE. The mean transepithelial potential (TEP) was 1.19 ± 0.24 mV (mean ± SEM, n = 31), apical positive, and the mean transepithelial resistance (RT) was 178.7 ± 9.9 Ω·cm2 (mean ± SEM, n = 31). Application of 100 μM adenosine triphosphate (ATP) apically increased net fluid absorption (Jv) by 6.11 ± 0.53 μL·cm2·h-1 (mean ± SEM, n = 6) and TEP by 0.33 ± 0.048 mV (mean ± SEM, n = 25). Gene expression of cultured RPE was comparable to native adult RPE (n = 5); however, native RPE RNA was harvested between 24 and 40 hours after death and, therefore, may not accurately reflect healthy native RPE. Vascular endothelial growth factor secreted preferentially basally 2582 ± 146 pg/mL/d, compared to an apical secretion of 1548 ± 162 pg/mL/d (n = 14, P {\textless} 0.01), while PEDF preferentially secreted apically 1487 ± 280 ng/mL/d compared to a basolateral secretion of 864 ± 132 ng/mL/d (n = 14, P {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The new culture model preserves native RPE morphology, electrophysiology, and gene and protein expression patterns, and may be a useful model to study RPE physiology, disease, and transplantation.},

Alternative usage of transcript isoforms from the same gene has been hypothesized as an important feature in cancers. However, differential usage of gene transcripts between conditions (isoform switching) has not been comprehensively characterized in and across cancer types. To this end, we developed methods for identification and visualization of isoform switches with predicted functional consequences. Using these methods, we characterized isoform switching in RNA-seq data from {\textgreater}5,500 cancer patients covering 12 solid cancer types. Isoform switches with potential functional consequences were common, affecting approximately 19\% of multiple transcript genes. Among these, isoform switches leading to loss of DNA sequence encoding protein domains were more frequent than expected, particularly in pancancer switches. We identified several isoform switches as powerful biomarkers: 31 switches were highly predictive of patient survival independent of cancer types. Our data constitute an important resource for cancer researchers, available through interactive web tools. Moreover, our methods, available as an R package, enable systematic analysis of isoform switches from other RNA-seq datasets.
Implications: This study indicates that isoform switches with predicted functional consequences are common and important in dysfunctional cells, which in turn means that gene expression should be analyzed at the isoform level.

Cell type-specific isoform expression of these genes also occurs. Although these changes appear to be coordinated, it is unclear how changes in these disparate cell types may be linked. The transcription factor Hic2 is required for normal cardiac development and the mutant is embryonic lethal. Hic2 embryos exhibit precocious expression of the definitive-lineage haemoglobin Hbb-bt in circulating primitive erythrocytes and of foetal isoforms of cardiomyocyte genes (creatine kinase, Ckm, and eukaryotic elongation factor Eef1a2) as well as ectopic cardiac expression of fast-twitch skeletal muscle troponin isoforms. We propose that HIC2 regulates a switching event within both the contractile machinery of cardiomyocytes and the oxygen carrying systems during the developmental period where demands on cardiac loading change rapidly.,

	abstract = {The parietal cortex of the human brain plays a unique role in the coordination of movement and in the integration of signals from the other cortices. Because of its extensive connections and involvement in many higher-order cognitive functions, neurodegenerative changes in the parietal lobe are believed to be crucial in the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Little is known about the transcriptome of this part of the human brain or how it is perturbed by the neurodegenerative process. To that end, we performed mRNA sequencing using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique on samples derived from normal and AD parietal lobes. Gene expression analysis evaluating alternatively spliced isoform expression and promoter usage revealed surprisingly elevated transcriptome activity in the AD condition. This phenomenon was particularly apparent in the alternative usage of transcriptional start sites. A Gene Ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed enrichment in the functional pathways related to lipid metabolism, thus highlighting the importance of astrocyte activity in the neurodegenerative process. We also identified an upregulation of the diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) gene in AD, as the result of a splicing switch toward shorter, intron-retaining isoforms driven by alternative promoters and was coupled with a simultaneous decrease in the abundance of protein-coding transcripts. These two DBI isoforms have not been described previously.},

We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5\%) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3′-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.

However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

Here, we detect previously unannotated transcription from Genotype-Tissue Expression RNA sequencing data across 41 human tissues. We connect this unannotated transcription to known genes, confirming that human gene annotation remains incomplete, even among well-studied genes including 63\% of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man–morbid catalog and 317 neurodegeneration-associated genes. We find the greatest abundance of unannotated transcription in brain and genes highly expressed in brain are more likely to be reannotated. We explore examples of reannotated disease genes, such as SNCA, for which we experimentally validate a previously unidentified, brain-specific, potentially protein-coding exon. We release all tissue-specific transcriptomes through vizER: http://rytenlab.com/browser/app/vizER. We anticipate that this resource will facilitate more accurate genetic analysis, with the greatest impact on our understanding of Mendelian and complex neurogenetic disorders.
Incomplete annotation has the greatest impact on brain-specific genes and consequently, brain-related disorders.

	abstract = {Deep sequencing of embryonic stem cell RNA revealed many specific internal introns that are significantly more abundant than the other introns within polyadenylated transcripts; we classified these as “detained” introns (DIs). We identified thousands of DIs, many of which are evolutionarily conserved, in human and mouse cell lines as well as the adult mouse liver. DIs can have half-lives of over an hour yet remain in the nucleus and are not subject to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Drug inhibition of Clk, a stress-responsive kinase, triggered rapid splicing changes for a specific subset of DIs; half showed increased splicing, and half showed increased intron detention, altering transcript pools of {\textgreater}300 genes. Srsf4, which undergoes a dramatic phosphorylation shift in response to Clk kinase inhibition, regulates the splicing of some DIs, particularly in genes encoding RNA processing and splicing factors. The splicing of some DIs—including those in Mdm4, a negative regulator of p53—was also altered following DNA damage. After 4 h of Clk inhibition, the expression of {\textgreater}400 genes changed significantly, and almost one-third of these are p53 transcriptional targets. These data suggest a widespread mechanism by which the rate of splicing of DIs contributes to the level of gene expression.},

	abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

	abstract = {Retinal development is dependent on an accurately functioning network of transcriptional and translational regulators. Among the diverse classes of molecules involved, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a significant role. Members of this family are present in the cell as transcripts, but are not translated into proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ncRNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators. During the last decade, they have been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including the development of the nervous system. On the other hand, long-ncRNAs (lncRNAs) represent a different class of ncRNAs that act mainly through processes involving chromatin remodeling and epigenetic mechanisms. The visual system is a prominent model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis or circuit formation and function, including the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells to generate the seven principal cell classes in the retina, pathfinding decisions of retinal ganglion cell axons in order to establish the correct connectivity from the eye to the brain proper, and activity-dependent mechanisms for the functionality of visual circuits. Recent findings have associated ncRNAs in several of these processes and uncovered a new level of complexity for the existing regulatory mechanisms. This review summarizes and highlights the impact of ncRNAs during the development of the vertebrate visual system, with a specific focus on the role of miRNAs and a synopsis regarding recent findings on lncRNAs in the retina.},

	abstract = {Human stem-cell derivatives are likely to play an important role in the future of regenerative medicine. Evaluation and comparison to their in vivo counterparts is critical for assessment of their therapeutic potential. Transcriptomics was used to compare a new differentiation derivative of human embryonic stem (hES) cells--retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)--to human fetal RPE. Several hES cell lines were differentiated into putative RPE, which expressed RPEspecific molecular markers and was capable of phagocytosis, an important RPE function. Isolated hES cell-derived RPE was able to transdifferentiate into cells of neuronal lineage and redifferentiate into RPE-like cells through multiple passages ({\textgreater}30 Population doublings). Gene expression profiling demonstrated their higher similarity to primary RPE tissue than of existing human RPE cell lines D407 and ARPE-19, which has been shown to attenuate loss of visual function in animals. This is the first report of the isolation and characterization of putative RPE cells from hES cells, as well as the first application of transcriptomics to assess embryonic stem-cell derivatives and their in vivo counterparts--a "differentiomics" outlook. We describe for the first time, a differentiation system that does not require coculture with animal cells or factors, thus allowing the production of zoonoses-free RPE cells suitable for subretinal transplantation in patients with retinal degenerative diseases. With the further development of therapeutic cloning, or the creation of the banks of homozygous human leucocyte antigen (HLA) hES cells using parthenogenesis, RPE lines could be generated to overcome the problem of immune rejection and could be one of the nearest term applications of stem-cell technology.},

	abstract = {Methods for detecting nucleotide substitution rates that are faster or slower than expected under neutral drift are widely used to identify candidate functional elements in genomic sequences. However, most existing methods consider either reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate but not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across the branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the more general problem of detecting departures from the neutral rate of substitution in either direction, possibly in a clade-specific manner. We consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing this problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based on exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) test. All four tests have been implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably similar in statistical power. With 36 mammalian species, they all appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low false-positive rates in detecting strong selection at individual nucleotides, moderate selection in 3-bp elements, and weaker or clade-specific selection in longer elements. By applying phyloP to mammalian multiple alignments from the ENCODE project, we shed light on patterns of conservation/acceleration in known and predicted functional elements, approximate fractions of sites subject to constraint, and differences in clade-specific selection in the primate and glires clades. We also describe new “Conservation” tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser that display both phyloP and phastCons scores for genome-wide alignments of 44 vertebrate species.},

This analysis reveals three developmental windows with specific gene expression patterns that informed the sequential emergence of retinal cell types and enabled identification of stage-specific cellular and biological processes, and transcriptional regulators. Each stage is characterised by a specific set of alternatively spliced transcripts that code for proteins involved in the formation of the photoreceptor connecting cilium, pre-mRNA splicing and epigenetic modifiers. Importantly, our data show that the transition from foetal to adult retina is characterised by a large increase in the percentage of mutually exclusive exons that code for proteins involved in photoreceptor maintenance. The circular RNA population is also defined and shown to increase during retinal development. Collectively, these data increase our understanding of human retinal development and the pre-mRNA splicing process, and help to identify new candidate disease genes.},

	abstract = {Most irreversible blindness results from retinal disease. To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of {\textasciitilde}85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90\% of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing.},

Approximately three thousands of samples, consisting of a variety of primary cells, tissues, cell lines, and time series samples during cell activation and development, were subjected to a uniform pipeline of CAGE data production. The analysis pipeline started by measuring RNA extracts to assess their quality, and continued to CAGE library production by using a robotic or a manual workflow, single molecule sequencing, and computational processing to generate frequencies of transcription initiation. Resulting data represents the consequence of transcriptional regulation in each analyzed state of mammalian cells. Non-overlapping peaks over the CAGE profiles, approximately 200,000 and 150,000 peaks for the human and mouse genomes, were identified and annotated to provide precise location of known promoters as well as novel ones, and to quantify their activities.},

	abstract = {Background— Ischemia-induced cardiomyopathy usually is accompanied by elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which follows from increased myocardial stiffness resulting from upregulated collagen expression. In addition to collagen, a main determinant of stiffness is titin, whose role in ischemia-induced left ventricular stiffening was studied here. Human heart sarcomeres coexpress 2 principal titin isoforms, a more compliant N2BA isoform and a stiffer N2B isoform. In comparison, normal rat hearts express almost no N2BA titin.Methods and Results— Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were used to determine the N2BA-to-N2B titin isoform ratio in nonischemic human hearts and nonnecrotic left ventricle of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. The average N2BA-to-N2B ratio was 47:53 in severely diseased CAD transplanted hearts and 32:68 in nonischemic transplants. In normal donor hearts and donor hearts with CAD background, relative N2BA titin content was ≈30\%. The titin isoform shift in CAD transplant hearts coincided with a high degree of modifications of cardiac troponin I, probably indicating increased preload. Immunofluorescence microscopy on CAD transplant specimens showed a regular cross-striated arrangement of titin and increased expression of collagen and desmin. Force measurements on isolated myofibrils revealed reduced passive-tension levels in sarcomeres of CAD hearts with high left ventricular end-diastolic pressure compared with sarcomeres of normal hearts. In a rat model of ischemia-induced myocardial infarction (left anterior descending coronary artery ligature), 43\% of animals, but only 14\% of sham-operated animals, showed a distinct N2BA titin band on gels.Conclusions— A titin isoform switch was observed in chronically ischemic human hearts showing extensive remodeling, which necessitated cardiac transplantation. The shift, also confirmed in rat hearts, caused reduced titin-derived myofibrillar stiffness. Titin modifications in long-term ischemic myocardium could impair the ability of the heart to use the Frank-Starling mechanism.},

	abstract = {The acceleration of DNA sequencing in samples from patients and population studies has resulted in extensive catalogues of human genetic variation, but the interpretation of rare genetic variants remains problematic. A notable example of this challenge is the existence of disruptive variants in dosage-sensitive disease genes, even in apparently healthy individuals. Here, by manual curation of putative loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in haploinsufficient disease genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)1, we show that one explanation for this paradox involves alternative splicing of mRNA, which allows exons of a gene to be expressed at varying levels across different cell types. Currently, no existing annotation tool systematically incorporates information about exon expression into the interpretation of variants. We develop a transcript-level annotation metric known as the ‘proportion expressed across transcripts’, which quantifies isoform expression for variants. We calculate this metric using 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project2 and show that it can differentiate between weakly and highly evolutionarily conserved exons, a proxy for functional importance. We demonstrate that expression-based annotation selectively filters 22.8\% of falsely annotated pLoF variants found in haploinsufficient disease genes in gnomAD, while removing less than 4\% of high-confidence pathogenic variants in the same genes. Finally, we apply our expression filter to the analysis of de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability or developmental disorders to show that pLoF variants in weakly expressed regions have similar effect sizes to those of synonymous variants, whereas pLoF variants in highly expressed exons are most strongly enriched among cases. Our annotation is fast, flexible and generalizable, making it possible for any variant file to be annotated with any isoform expression dataset, and will be valuable for the genetic diagnosis of rare diseases, the analysis of rare variant burden in complex disorders, and the curation and prioritization of variants in recall-by-genotype studies.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing of precursor mRNA is an essential mechanism to increase the complexity of gene expression, and it plays an important role in cellular differentiation and organism development. Regulation of alternative splicing is a complicated process in which numerous interacting components are at work, including cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors, and is further guided by the functional coupling between transcription and splicing. Additional molecular features, such as chromatin structure, RNA structure and alternative transcription initiation or alternative transcription termination, collaborate with these basic components to generate the protein diversity due to alternative splicing. All these factors contributing to this one fundamental biological process add up to a mechanism that is critical to the proper functioning of cells. Any corruption of the process may lead to disruption of normal cellular function and the eventuality of disease. Cancer is one of those diseases, where alternative splicing may be the basis for the identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as new strategies for therapy. Thus, an in-depth understanding of alternative splicing regulation has the potential not only to elucidate fundamental biological principles, but to provide solutions for various diseases.},

Using a positional cloning approach for identifying the BBS4 (chromosome 15) gene, we identified and cloned an unconventional myosin gene, myosin IXA (HGMW-approved symbol MYO9A). Since mutations in unconventional myosins are known to cause several human diseases, and since mutations of unconventional myosin VIIa cause retinal degeneration, we evaluated myosin IXA as a candidate for BBS. We exploited PCR-based techniques to clone a 8473-nt cDNA for myosin IXA. A 7644-bp open reading frame predicts a protein with all the hallmarks of class IX unconventional myosins. Human Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization of mouse embryos reveal that myosin IXA is expressed in many tissues consistent with BBS. Intron/exon boundaries were identified, and myosin IXA DNA and RNA from BBS4 patients were evaluated for mutation.},

However, microarrays do not perform well on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPET). Consequently, microarrays cannot be effectively utilized to perform gene expression profiling on the vast majority of archival tumor samples. To address this limitation of gene expression microarrays, we designed a novel procedure (3′-end sequencing for expression quantification (3SEQ)) for gene expression profiling from FFPET using next-generation sequencing. We performed gene expression profiling by 3SEQ and microarray on both frozen tissue and FFPET from two soft tissue tumors (desmoid type fibromatosis (DTF) and solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)) (total n = 23 samples, which were each profiled by at least one of the four platform-tissue preparation combinations). Analysis of 3SEQ data revealed many genes differentially expressed between the tumor types (FDR{\textless}0.01) on both the frozen tissue (∼9.6K genes) and FFPET (∼8.1K genes). Analysis of microarray data from frozen tissue revealed fewer differentially expressed genes (∼4.64K), and analysis of microarray data on FFPET revealed very few (69) differentially expressed genes. Functional gene set analysis of 3SEQ data from both frozen tissue and FFPET identified biological pathways known to be important in DTF and SFT pathogenesis and suggested several additional candidate oncogenic pathways in these tumors. These findings demonstrate that 3SEQ is an effective technique for gene expression profiling from archival tumor samples and may facilitate significant advances in translational cancer research.},

Here, we demonstrate that the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), essential for photoreceptor development and function, requires a functional primary cilium for complete maturation and that RPE maturation defects in ciliopathies precede photoreceptor degeneration. Pharmacologically enhanced ciliogenesis in wild-type induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-RPE leads to fully mature and functional cells. In contrast, ciliopathy patient-derived iPSC-RPE and iPSC-RPE with a knockdown of ciliary-trafficking protein remain immature, with defective apical processes, reduced functionality, and reduced adult-specific gene expression. Proteins of the primary cilium regulate RPE maturation by simultaneously suppressing canonical WNT and activating PKCδ pathways. A similar cilium-dependent maturation pathway exists in lung epithelium. Our results provide insights into ciliopathy-induced retinal degeneration, demonstrate a developmental role for primary cilia in epithelial maturation, and provide a method to mature iPSC epithelial cells for clinical applications., 
          
        , May-Simera et al. show that primary cilia regulate the maturation and polarization of human iPSC-RPE, mouse RPE, and human iPSC-lung epithelium through canonical WNT suppression and PKCδ activation.

To identify new compounds that promote RPE differentiation, we developed and performed a high-throughput quantitative PCR screen complemented by a novel orthogonal human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based RPE reporter assay. Chetomin, an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factors, was found to strongly increase RPE differentiation; combination with nicotinamide resulted in conversion of over one-half of the differentiating cells into RPE. Single passage of the whole culture yielded a highly pure hPSC-RPE cell population that displayed many of the morphological, molecular, and functional characteristics of native RPE.},

	abstract = {During vertebrate eye development, the transcription factor MITF plays central roles in neuroepithelial domain specification and differentiation of the retinal pigment epithelium. MITF, however, is not a single protein but represents a family of isoforms that are generated from a common gene by alternative promoter/exon use. To address the question of the role and regulation of these isoforms, we first determined their expression patterns in developing mouse eyes and analyzed the role of some of them in genetic models. We found that two isoforms, A- and J-Mitf, are present throughout development in both retina and pigment epithelium while H-Mitf is detected preferentially and D-Mitf exclusively in the pigment epithelium. We further found that a genomic deletion encompassing the promoter/exon regions of H-, D- and B-Mitf leads to novel mRNA isoforms and proteins translated from internal start sites. These novel proteins lack the normal, isoform-specific aminoterminal sequences and are unable to support the development of the pigment epithelium but capable of inducing pigmentation in the ciliary margin and the iris. Moreover, in mutants of the retinal Mitf regulator Chx10, reduced cell proliferation and abnormal pigmentation of the retina are associated with a preferential upregulation of H- and D-Mitf. This retinal phenotype is corrected when H- and D-Mitf are missing in double Mitf/Chx10 mutants. The results suggest that Mitf regulation in the developing eye is isoform-selective both temporally and spatially, and that some isoforms, including H- and D-Mitf, are more critical than others in effecting normal retina and pigment epithelium development.},

	abstract = {Purpose
ABCA4-associated disease, a recessive retinal dystrophy, is hallmarked by a large proportion of patients with only one pathogenic ABCA4 variant, suggestive for missing heritability.

Methods
By locus-specific analysis of ABCA4, combined with extensive functional studies, we aimed to unravel the missing alleles in a cohort of 67 patients (p), with one (p = 64) or no (p = 3) identified coding pathogenic variants of ABCA4.

Results
We identified eight pathogenic (deep-)intronic ABCA4 splice variants, of which five are novel and six structural variants, four of which are novel, including two duplications. Together, these variants account for the missing alleles in 40.3\% of patients. Furthermore, two novel variants with a putative cis-regulatory effect were identified. The common hypomorphic variant c.5603A{\textgreater}T p.(Asn1868Ile) was found as a candidate second allele in 43.3\% of patients. Overall, we have elucidated the missing heritability in 83.6\% of our cohort. In addition, we successfully rescued three deep-intronic variants using antisense oligonucleotide (AON)-mediated treatment in HEK 293-T cells and in patient-derived fibroblast cells.

Conclusion
Noncoding pathogenic variants, novel structural variants, and a common hypomorphic allele of the ABCA4 gene explain the majority of unsolved cases with ABCA4-associated disease, rendering this retinopathy a model for missing heritability in autosomal recessive disorders.},

	abstract = {Mutations in ABCA4 cause Stargardt disease and other blinding autosomal recessive retinal disorders. However, sequencing of the complete coding sequence in patients with clinical features of Stargardt disease sometimes fails to detect one or both mutations. For example, among 208 individuals with clear clinical evidence of ABCA4 disease ascertained at a single institution, 28 had only one disease-causing allele identified in the exons and splice junctions of the primary retinal transcript of the gene. Haplotype analysis of these 28 probands revealed 3 haplotypes shared among ten families, suggesting that 18 of the 28 missing alleles were rare enough to be present only once in the cohort. We hypothesized that mutations near rare alternate splice junctions in ABCA4 might cause disease by increasing the probability of mis-splicing at these sites. Next-generation sequencing of RNA extracted from human donor eyes revealed more than a dozen alternate exons that are occasionally incorporated into the ABCA4 transcript in normal human retina. We sequenced the genomic DNA containing 15 of these minor exons in the 28 one-allele subjects and observed five instances of two different variations in the splice signals of exon 36.1 that were not present in normal individuals (P {\textless} 10−6). Analysis of RNA obtained from the keratinocytes of patients with these mutations revealed the predicted alternate transcript. This study illustrates the utility of RNA sequence analysis of human donor tissue and patient-derived cell lines to identify mutations that would be undetectable by exome sequencing.},

Complete sequencing of ABCA4 in STGD patients identifies compound heterozygous or homozygous disease-associated alleles in 65–70\% of patients and only one mutation in 15–20\% of patients. This study was designed to find the missing disease-causing ABCA4 variation by a combination of next-generation sequencing (NGS), array-Comparative Genome Hybridization (aCGH) screening, familial segregation and in silico analyses. The entire 140 kb ABCA4 genomic locus was sequenced in 114 STGD patients with one known ABCA4 exonic mutation revealing, on average, 200 intronic variants per sample. Filtering of these data resulted in 141 candidates for new mutations. Two variants were detected in four samples, two in three samples, and 20 variants in two samples, the remaining 117 new variants were detected only once. Multimodal analysis suggested 12 new likely pathogenic intronic ABCA4 variants, some of which were specific to (isolated) ethnic groups. No copy number variation (large deletions and insertions) was detected in any patient suggesting that it is a very rare event in the ABCA4 locus. Many variants were excluded since they were not conserved in non-human primates, were frequent in African populations and, therefore, represented ancestral, and not disease-associated, variants. The sequence variability in the ABCA4 locus is extensive and the non-coding sequences do not harbor frequent mutations in STGD patients of European-American descent. Defining disease-associated alleles in the ABCA4 locus requires exceptionally well characterized large cohorts and extensive analyses by a combination of various approaches.},

Among those, IFT140 is implicated in a variety of phenotypes ranging from isolated retinis pigmentosa to more syndromic cases. Using whole-genome sequencing in patients with uncharacterized ciliopathies, we identified a novel recurrent tandem duplication of exon 27-30 (6.7 kb) in IFT140, c.3454-488\_4182+2588dup p.(Tyr1152\_Thr1394dup), missed by whole-exome sequencing. Pathogenicity of the mutation was assessed on the patients' skin fibroblasts. Several hundreds of patients with a ciliopathy phenotype were screened and biallelic mutations were identified in 11 families representing 12 pathogenic variants of which seven are novel. Among those unrelated families especially with a Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, eight carried the same tandem duplication (two at the homozygous state and six at the heterozygous state). In conclusion, we demonstrated the implication of structural variations in IFT140-related diseases expanding its mutation spectrum. We also provide evidences for a unique genomic event mediated by an Alu-Alu recombination occurring on a shared haplotype. We confirm that whole-genome sequencing can be instrumental in the ability to detect structural variants for genomic disorders.},

	abstract = {Several genes have been implicated in the autosomal recessive form of cone–rod dystrophy (CRD), but the majority of cases remain unsolved. We identified a homozygous interval comprising two known genes associated with the autosomal recessive form of CRD, namely RAB28 and PROM1, in a consanguineous family with clinical evidence of CRD. Both genes proved to be mutation negative upon sequencing of exons and canonical splice sites but whole-genome sequencing revealed a private variant located deep in intron 18 of PROM1. In silico and functional analyses of this variant using minigenes as splicing reporters revealed the integration of a pseudoexon in the mutant transcript, thereby leading to a premature termination codon and presumably resulting in a functional null allele. This is the first report of a deep intronic variant that acts as a splicing mutation in PROM1. The detection of such variants escapes the exon-focused techniques typically used in genetic analyses. Sequencing the entire genomic regions of known disease genes might identify more causal mutations in the autosomal recessive form of CRD.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Using exome sequencing, the underlying variants in many persons with autosomal recessive diseases remain undetected. We explored autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) as a model to identify the missing heritability.

Methods
Sequencing of ABCA4 was performed in 8 STGD1 cases with one variant and p.Asn1868Ile in trans, 25 cases with one variant, and 3 cases with no ABCA4 variant. The effect of intronic variants was analyzed using in vitro splice assays in HEK293T cells and patient-derived fibroblasts. Antisense oligonucleotides were used to correct splice defects.

Results
In 24 of the probands (67\%), one known and five novel deep-intronic variants were found. The five novel variants resulted in messenger RNA pseudoexon inclusions, due to strengthening of cryptic splice sites or by disrupting a splicing silencer motif. Variant c.769-784C{\textgreater}T showed partial insertion of a pseudoexon and was found in cis with c.5603A{\textgreater}T (p.Asn1868Ile), so its causal role could not be fully established. Variant c.4253+43G{\textgreater}A resulted in partial skipping of exon 28. Remarkably, antisense oligonucleotides targeting the aberrant splice processes resulted in (partial) correction of all splicing defects.

Conclusion
Our data demonstrate the importance of assessing noncoding variants in genetic diseases, and show the great potential of splice modulation therapy for deep-intronic variants.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
With the advent of gene therapies for inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs), genetic diagnostics will have an increasing role in clinical decision-making. Yet the genetic cause of disease cannot be identified using exon-based sequencing for a significant portion of patients. We hypothesized that non-coding mutations contribute significantly to the genetic causality of IRDs and evaluated patients with single coding mutations in RPGRIP1 to test this hypothesis.

Methods:
IRD families underwent targeted panel sequencing. Unsolved cases were explored by whole exome and genome sequencing looking for additional mutations. Candidate mutations were then validated by Sanger sequencing, quantitative PCR, and in vitro splicing assays in two cell lines analyzed through amplicon sequencing.

Results:
Among 1722 families, three had biallelic loss of function mutations in RPGRIP1 while seven had a single disruptive coding mutation. Whole exome and genome sequencing revealed potential non-coding mutations in these seven families. In six, the non-coding mutations were shown to lead to loss of function in vitro.

Conclusion:
Non-coding mutations were identified in 6 of 7 families with single coding mutations in RPGRIP1. The results suggest that non-coding mutations contribute significantly to the genetic causality of IRDs and RPGRIP1–mediated IRDs are more common than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) is an inherited blinding disorder caused by mutations in the Abca4 gene. ABCA4 is a flippase in photoreceptor outer segments (OS) that translocates retinaldehyde conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine across OS disc membranes. Loss of ABCA4 in Abca4−/− mice and STGD1 patients causes buildup of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and degeneration of photoreceptors, leading to blindness. No effective treatment currently exists for STGD1. Here we show by several approaches that ABCA4 is additionally expressed in RPE cells. (i) By in situ hybridization analysis and by RNA-sequencing analysis, we show the Abca4 mRNA is expressed in human and mouse RPE cells. (ii) By quantitative immunoblotting, we show that the level of ABCA4 protein in homogenates of wild-type mouse RPE is about 1\% of the level in neural retina homogenates. (iii) ABCA4 immunofluorescence is present in RPE cells of wild-type and Mertk−/− but not Abca4−/− mouse retina sections, where it colocalizes with endolysosomal proteins. To elucidate the role of ABCA4 in RPE cells, we generated a line of genetically modified mice that express ABCA4 in RPE cells but not in photoreceptors. Mice from this line on the Abca4−/− background showed partial rescue of photoreceptor degeneration and decreased lipofuscin accumulation compared with nontransgenic Abca4−/− mice. We propose that ABCA4 functions to recycle retinaldehyde released during proteolysis of rhodopsin in RPE endolysosomes following daily phagocytosis of distal photoreceptor OS. ABCA4 deficiency in the RPE may play a role in the pathogenesis of STGD1.},

	abstract = {During forebrain development, LRP2 promotes morphogen signaling as an auxiliary SHH receptor. However, in the developing retina, LRP2 assumes the opposing function, mediating endocytic clearance of SHH and antagonizing morphogen action. LRP2-mediated clearance prevents spread of SHH activity from the central retina into the retinal margin to protect quiescent progenitor cells in this niche from mitogenic stimuli. Loss of LRP2 in mice increases the sensitivity of the retinal margin for SHH, causing expansion of the retinal progenitor cell pool and hyperproliferation of this tissue. Our findings document the ability of LRP2 to act, in a context-dependent manner, as activator or inhibitor of the SHH pathway. Our current findings uncovered LRP2 activity as the molecular mechanism imposing quiescence of the retinal margin in the mammalian eye and suggest SHH-induced proliferation of the retinal margin as cause of the large eye phenotype observed in mouse models and patients with LRP2 defects.},

The hPSC-derived retinal progenitors are found to self-organize into three-dimensional optic vesicle-like structures, with each aggregate possessing the ability to differentiate into all major retinal cell types. The ability to faithfully recapitulate the stepwise in vivo development in a three-dimensional cell culture system allows for the study of mechanisms underlying human retinogenesis.

We performed fine mapping of AMD risk loci by integrating molecular data from the iPSC-RPE, adult retina, and adult RPE, which identified rs943080 as the probable causal variant at VEGFA.
